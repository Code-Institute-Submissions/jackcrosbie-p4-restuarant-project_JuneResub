## Introduction

This is my submission for the portfolio 4, Fullstack toolkit, project. It is a booking system and website for a fictional restuarant.
Within the website will be a reservations/booking system. Here the information will be stored on a PostgreSQL database and will be able to be maintained and edited by the superuser.

### Demo

Live link will be deployed here !!!

## UX

Utilising UX design is essential these days to provide meaningful and relevant experiences to the user. To provide more balance and structure to my UX design I opted to use the five planes method to design and implement on my website.

### Strategy

**Vision**

The vision of the website is to enable users an easy method to reserve a table and stay up to date with what the restuarant has to offer.
This provides an overall better user experience and enables the user to make edits/corrections to their reservations.
From an Admin point of view the website would mean less work when it came through the management and organistion of bookings/reservations.

**Aims**

1. Provide a stylish, easy to use and intuitive website.
2. Implement a booking system which is easily maintained and straightforward to use.
3. Supply a contact form for any special requests/large booking parties which goes from the user to the admin.
4. Display an updated version of the menu which is easy to maintain and edit for the site admin.
5. Enable users to Login/Logout, autofilling information when logged in to save time when making future bookings.
